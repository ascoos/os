## Getting Started
1. Ensure Ascoos OS is installed (see the [main repository](https://github.com/ascoos/os)). If using the [`ASCOOS Web Extended Studio (AWES) 26`](https://awes.ascoos.com), Ascoos OS is preloaded.
2. Navigate to the case study directories (e.g., `/examples/case-studies/websites/linguistic_analysis/`).
3. Follow the instructions and information in each case study's markdown files.
